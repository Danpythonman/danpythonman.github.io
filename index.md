Hello! Welcome to my Github Pages website. Here you will find information about me and the projects I have completed.

## About me
I am currently an engineering student at York University and am in the process of declaring a major in software engineering.
I excelled in coding the courses I took in high school and university.
I have been coding as a hobby for a few years, mostly making small applications with GUIs in Python and experimenting with website development with Python and the standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
To make my larger projects available online, and to practice using Git, I have been making GitHub repositories for these projects.
They are listed below.
